<%= h1 "What is TopUp?" %>
<p>
  TopUp is an easy to use Javascript library for unobtrusively displaying images and webpages in a Web 2.0 approach of popups.
  The library is <%= link_to "jQuery", "http://jquery.com" %> driven in order to maintain cross-browser compatibility and compactness.
  TopUp offers the following advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A very easy setup process</li>
  <li>The ability of displaying images, iframes, webpages and pure HTML</li>
  <li>TopUp can be used along with <%= link_to "Prototype", "http://prototypejs.org" %> (just include TopUp before Prototype)</li>
  <li>TopUp is compressed with <%= link_to "Yahoo! YUI Compressor", "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" %> to <%= number_to_human_size File.size("#{RAILS_ROOT}/assets/releases/latest/top_up-min.js") %> (includes JS, HTML and CSS)</li>
  <li>Usage of CSS sprites to reduce the amount of image requests to two per layout for <%= link_to "faster loading", "http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" %></li>
  <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
  <li>Fancy layouts, animations and transitions</li>
  <li>Auto-correction of size and position when required</li>
  <li>The possibility to create groups</li>
  <li>Support for AJAX requests</li>
  <li>And many more...</li>
</ul>

<%= h1 "Why another Lightbox-like Javascript library?" %>
<p>
  Just like many among us, I had the need for a lightbox-like library to use for a website I was working on.
  After examining libraries such as <%= link_to "Lightbox", "http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/" %>, <%= link_to "Lightbox2", "http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" %>, 
  <%= link_to "LightWindow", "http://stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/" %>, <%= link_to "Highslide", "http://highslide.com/" %>, <%= link_to "Thickbox", "http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/" %>, 
  <%= link_to "ModalBox", "http://www.wildbit.com/labs/modalbox/" %> and many more, I haven't found one that really suited my needs. Either the installation was to complicated, the 
  look-and-feel wasn't pretty, the transitions were glitchy, conflicts with other libraries occured or the possibilities were lacking.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Enter TopUp!</strong> The installation of TopUp consists of including only one file (<strong>no images or stylesheets!</strong>), the look-and-feel is Apple-like, the animations 
  and transitions look fancy, you can still use Prototype, it is so easy to specify options and last but not least: you can stay updated with the latest version without changing any code.
  Great for expansions and bugfixes!
