= TopUp

The #1 Javascript Pop Up / Lightbox

== Introduction

TopUp ( http://gettopup.com ) is an easy to use Javascript library for unobtrusively displaying images and webpages in a Web 2.0 approach of popups.
The library is jQuery ( http://jquery.com ) and jQuery UI ( http://jqueryui.com ) driven in order to maintain cross-browser compatibility and compactness.
TopUp offers the following advantages:

  * TopUp is absolutely free, also for commercial use ( see also http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 )
  * A very easy setup process ( only one include and nothing more, see http://gettopup.com#installation )
  * Using TopUp presets ( http://gettopup.com/examples#grouped_links ) keeps your HTML code 100% clean, no extra 
    code needed whatsoever
  * The ability of displaying images, flash (from sites like Youtube, SWF and FLV files), movies (QuickTime, Windows 
    Media and Realplayer), iframes, DOM elements and raw HTML
  * TopUp can be used along with Prototype ( http://prototypejs.org ) (just include TopUp before Prototype)
  * TopUp is compressed with Yahoo! YUI Compressor ( http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ )
  * Usage of CSS sprites to reduce the amount of image requests to two per layout for faster loading
    ( see also http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html )
  * Fancy layouts, animations and transitions
  * Auto-correction of size and position when required
  * The possibility to create groups
  * Support for AJAX requests

== How to develop TopUp yourself

Any help concerning bugfixes and improvements for TopUp is appreciated. Setting the environment up consists of only following 5 easy steps described below.
But before we go any furter, I think it's better that I'll explain one thing or two ;)

TopUp is developed in a Rails application. This gives us many advantages:

  * We don't have to mess with the HTML and CSS TopUp injects into the webpage
      HTML: use the standard Rails view templates
      CSS : use the power of SASS ( http://sass-lang.com ) to generate clean, correct and compact CSS
      JS  : use the power of Jzip ( http://github.com/archan937/jzip ) for merging the different combinations of the requirements to separate files
  * Release and pack a new release easily with the use of rake tasks
  * Test TopUp easily by adjusting and testing the homepage examples for instance

The locations of the TopUp resources are as follows:

  * TopUp Javascript file
    - public/javascripts/development/top_up.js (for the jQuery version)
    - public/javascripts/development/top_up-pt.js (for the Prototype version: pre-alpha phase)
  
  * TopUp layouts images
    - public/images/top_up/*

  * CSS - SASS templates
    - assets/sass/public/top_up/*
  
  * HTML - Rails view templates
    - app/views/layouts/_top_up.html.erb
    - app/views/layouts/_tu_top_up.html.erb
  
  * TopUp requirements - Jzip templates
    - assets/jzip/jquery
  
  * Rake tasks
    - lib/tasks/top_up.rake

So to develop TopUp yourself, you will have to setup the development environment and run the Rails application.
Doing this is a piece of cake, just follow these steps:

1. Get a clone of the TopUp repository and open that directory
   git clone git://github.com/archan937/topup.git && cd topup

2. Copy or rename config/environment.example.rb to config/environment.rb
   mv config/environment.example.rb config/environment.rb

3. Copy or rename config/database.example.yml to config/database.yml and correct the login settings
   mv config/database.example.yml config/database.yml

4. Create the database and run the migration task
   rake db:create && rake db:migrate

5. Run the Rails application
   ./script/server

6. Go do some cool scripting
   [ edit public/javascripts/development/top_up.js ]

7. Enjoy! :D
