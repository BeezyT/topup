= TopUp CHANGELOG

== Version 1.6.3.1 (December 21, 2009)

* Fixed handling the ondisplay and onclose callbacks when specified as toptions(!) (reported by TikkTakk-Aicon). Specify this as follows: ' toptions="ondisplay = alert(\"Hello world!\");" '
* Being able to determine the type automatically (thanks to Clement Joubert) even when the reference contains a timestamp (e.g. example.jpg?1256518937)

== Version 1.6.3 (December 21, 2009)

* Automatically calling TopUp.display (or TopUp.displayTopUp) with jQuery(document).ready() when necessary. In other words: you can call TopUp.display() whenever you want and TopUp will be displayed a.s.a.p. and thus also on page load (yay!)
* Added the 'flatlook' layout
* Added examples for inline DOM elements
* Added text shadow CSS to the title element in the 'dashboard' layout
* Added TopUp.version so you can call it's version
* Not showing scrollbars anymore when using the 'transform' effect for iframes, HTML and DOM elements
* Fixed TopUp resizing when displaying HTML or inline DOM elements within Topup
* Corrected the TopUp implementation for rendering inline DOM elements
* Cleaned up the effect determination a bit, this concerns the default and 'transform' effect
* FYI: TopUp releases are packed in .zip files from now on (yay!)

== Version 1.6.2.2 (December 15, 2009)

* Renamed the draggable() function to draggableZ() to prevent the jQuery UI draggable() function from being overriden

== Version 1.6.2.1 (November 15, 2009)

* Added {current} and {total} for using them as the current index and current group size in the TopUp window title respectively

== Version 1.6.2 (November 15, 2009)

* Fixed minor bug concerning the group index when opening TopUp for the second time, an image was displayed two times (credits to Timo Besenreuther for reporting this bug)
* Added the 'readAltText' toption to use the img alt text for the TopUp window title, you can pre and/or post fix it. See http://gettopup.com/documentation#available_toptions for more information (this feature was initiated by Timo Besenreuther)

== Version 1.6.1 (November 11, 2009)

* Made the script include for possible missing Javascript libraries more intelligent. It is at max only one(!) Javascript include. This solves the "jQuery(‚Äù#top_up .tu_frame").resizable is not a function" error and such (yay!)
* Altered the movie content embedment because of the "[object error]" in Internet Explorer. Embedding QuickTime, Windows Media (how ironic) en RealPlayer isn't possible in IE yet though. To be continued
